# Linked lists
My Python linked list implementation. This is my expanded implementation from the HackerRank challenged. Note it's kind of half finished and untested so probably broken in all manner of fun ways. It's recursive so won't be able to handle any serious load due to Python's lack of tail call optimisation.
